Compile with "make"

Run with "java AtomicGUI"

Or with java -jar AtomicGUI.jar

You will need the MERIFONT.TTF font file in the same directory.

When the GUI comes up, push the "RegisterNew" button and navigate
to the executable file (such as ATOMKRAFT.exe), and select it.
It will then bring up what will be the default selections. For now,
you can ignore this and just click "Save as Default" in the upper left.
Then, back to the main button bar, click the Load button, and the program
you just registered should pop up in a submenu. Upon selecting it, then
click the red circle to start the engine analysing (and the green to stop).
You can then make moves on the board, and the engine will follow.

To import games, use "Switch" and either "Load" a PGN file or "Paste"
a pgn snippet. To export, use "Emit", holding down Shift if you only
want the mainline of your analysis.
